# States

In your application, components can exhibit various states, similar to how a button might be enabled, disabled, or focused. These states enable components to dynamically apply different styles, enhancing their visual representation and behavior based on user interaction or application logic.

States are applied from the style object with a matching name and must be prefixed with `$`:

```jsx
const Button = {
  width: 386,
  height: 136,
  color: 0x546160ff,
  alpha: 0.8,
  scale: 1,
  $focus: {
    color: 0x58807dff,
    scale: 1.1,
    alpha: 1,
  },
  $disabled: {
    color: 0x333333ff,
  },
};
```

When `Button` is focused via the [useFocusManager](/primitives/useFocusManager.md), the `$focus` state will be added to the button, causing the focus styles to be applied. And when focus is removed, the original styles on the element will be set.

> Be sure to set defaults on the original styles if applying a new style via state. Example: clipping: false, focus: { clipping: true }

States can be added to components declaratively:

```jsx
<Button states={{ $active: true, $happy: false, $disabled: false }}>Movies</Button>
<Button states={'$active'}>Sports</Button>
<Button states='$happy'>News</Button>
```

Or imperatively:

```jsx
let myButton;

createEffect(() => {
  myButton.states.add('$focus');

  // Check for a state
  if (myButton.states.has('$focus')) {
    myButton.states.remove('$focus');
  }

  myButton.states.add('$disabled');
  // is and has are identical
  myButton.states.is('$disabled');

  // toggle disabled on / off
  myButton.states.toggle('$disabled');
});
<View ref={myButton} style={Button} />;
```

Note: states always use the values in the style object. If you have a button with a base color, and a disabled and focus state which both change the color, the value applied to the button will be determined from the style object. You won't be able to set the color of the button on the JSX `<Button color={???}>` because as the states change, we need to determine which color to apply. If you need this functionality, you should pass in the color to the style object.

## forwardStates

When you want the state to also be applied to children elements, you can add the `forwardStates` attribute to the parent element. Any states set on the parent will be added/removed from the children as well. This is useful for functional components where you need to change styles of children as well.

```jsx
function Button(props) {
  const ButtonContainer = {
    width: 386,
    height: 136,
    color: 0x000000ff,
    alpha: 0.3,
    scale: 1,
    transition: {
      scale: { duration: 1500, delay: 200, easing: 'easy-in' },
      alpha: { duration: 1500, delay: 200, easing: 'easy-in' },
    },
    $focus: {
      color: [0x58807dff, { duration: 2000 }],
      scale: 1.2,
      alpha: 1,
    },
  };

  const ButtonText = {
    fontSize: 32,
    lineHeight: Button.height,
    contain: 'width',
    textAlign: 'center',
    mountY: -0.35,
    color: 0xf6f6f9ff,
    height: Button.height,
    width: Button.width,
    $focus: {
      color: 0xffffffff,
    },
  };

  return (
    <View {...props} forwardStates style={ButtonContainer}>
      <Text style={ButtonText}>{props.children}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
