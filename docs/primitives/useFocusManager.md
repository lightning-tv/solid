# useFocusManager for Key Handling

The `useFocusManager` primitive is designed to handle user input, manage focus paths, and trigger focus and blur events on components. This primitive is set up once during app initialization and provides key handling capabilities.

## Usage

### Import and Setup

Import the `useFocusManager` and configure it with your custom key mappings:

```jsx
import { useFocusManager } from '@lightningtv/solid';

const App = () => {
  const focusPath = useFocusManager(
    // These are the default, so you can just call useFocusManager()
    {
      Left: ['ArrowLeft', 37],
      Right: ['ArrowRight', 39],
      Up: ['ArrowUp', 38],
      Down: ['ArrowDown', 40],
      Enter: 'Enter',
      Last: 'l',
    },
    // Second param is keyHoldMapEntries
    {
      userKeyHoldMap: {
        EnterHold: 'Enter',
      },
      holdThreshold: 150, //ms for how long to hold for
    },
  );

  // Additional application logic...
};
```

### Focus Path Tracking

The `useFocusManager` returns a signal, `focusPath`, which is an array of elements that currently have focus. When the `activeElement` changes, the focus path is recalculated. During this process:

- All elements in focus will have a `focus` state added, and `onFocus(currentFocusedElm, prevFocusedElm)` event is called.
- Elements losing focus will have the `focus` state removed, and `onBlur(currentFocusedElm, prevFocusedElm)` event is called.

There is also an `onFocusChanged(hasFocus, currentFocusedElm, prevFocusedElm)` callback which is useful for setting a focusSignal to use for more complicated scenarios.

```jsx
const [hasFocus, setHasFocus] = createSignal(false);
return <View onFocusChanged={setHasFocus}>{/* use hasFocus() */}</View>;
```

### Key Handling

When a key is pressed:

1. The `keyMap` looks for the key name and its corresponding value.
2. It then looks for `capture${key}` and `captureKey` from top down.
3. It then calls the `on${key}` handler, searching from focused element back up the tree.
4. If the key is not handled, it calls the generic `onKeyPress` on the active element and then propagates up through the focus path until the key press is handled.

The keyHandler signature is: `(this: ElementNode, e: Event, elm: ElementNode, finalFocusedElm: ElementNode) => boolean`

To stop the propagation of a key press, the handler must return `true`. Any other return value or no return value will continue to propagate the key press through the focus path, looking for additional handlers.

### Input Throttling (`Available Core 2.12+`)

You can now control input speed in two powerful ways . This feature helps prevent unwanted behavior from rapid key presses, leading to a smoother, more predictable user experience and giving you, the developer, precise control over input handling.

#### Global Throttling (`Config.throttleInput`)

For a quick, app-wide solution, you can set a global throttle on all key inputs directly in your configuration. This is perfect for setting a baseline input speed for your entire application.

```javascript
import { Config } from '@lightningtv/core';

// Allow one keypress every 200ms across the entire app
Config.throttleInput = 200;
```

#### Per-Element Throttling (`throttleInput` property)

For more granular control, you can add a `throttleInput` property directly to any ElementNode. This allows you specific components that might need a different throttle rate, like a fast-scrolling list or a sensitive menu item.

```jsx
// This Row will only accept a keypress every 500ms
<Row throttleInput={500}>...</Row>
```

### Key Release

On release of a key:

1. The `keyMap` looks for the key name and its corresponding value.
2. It calls the `on${key}Release` handler first.

Note: There is no generic `onKeyRelease`.

### Hold Key Handling

Recommended approach to Hold Key Handling is with the [useHold](./useHold.md) primitive as this will not delay any keypress events for elements which do not need Hold.

#### DEPRECATED - keyHold will be replaced with useHold

You can specify which keys you'd like tracked for Hold events globally as the second param to `useFocusManager`.

1. The `keyHoldMap` looks for the key name and its corresponding value.
2. It calls the `on${keyHold}` handler after `holdThreshold` || 500 ms.
3. If the key is not handled, it calls the generic `onKeyHold` on the active element and then propagates up through the focus path until the key press is handled.

The keyHandler signature is: `(this: ElementNode, e: Event, elm: ElementNode, finalFocusedElm: ElementNode) => boolean`

To stop the propagation of a key press, the handler must return `true`. Any other return value or no return value will continue to propagate the key press through the focus path, looking for additional handlers.

### Custom Key Mappings

You can pass in an array of keys for a single event. The custom keys object will be merged with the default key mapping:

```js
const defaultKeyMap = {
  ArrowLeft: 'Left',
  ArrowRight: 'Right',
  ArrowUp: 'Up',
  ArrowDown: 'Down',
  Enter: 'Enter',
  ' ': 'Space',
  Backspace: 'Back',
  Escape: 'Escape',
  37: 'Left',
  39: 'Right',
  38: 'Up',
  40: 'Down',
  13: 'Enter',
  32: 'Space',
  8: 'Back',
  27: 'Escape',
};
```

### Example

Here's a complete example of how to use `useFocusManager`:

```jsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';
import { useFocusManager } from '@lightningtv/solid';
import { Button } from '@lightningjs/solid-ui';

const App = () => {
  useFocusManager({
    Announcer: ["a"],
    Menu: ["m"],
    Escape: ["Escape", 27],
    Backspace: ["Backspace", 8],
    Left: ["ArrowLeft", 37],
    Right: ["ArrowRight", 39],
    Up: ["ArrowUp", 38],
    Down: ["ArrowDown", 40],
    Enter: ["Enter", 13],
  } as unknown as KeyMap, {
    userKeyHoldMap: {
      EnterHold: [ 'Enter', 13 ],
      BackHold: [ 'b', 66 ],
    } as unknown as KeyHoldMap,
    holdThreshold: 1000,
  });

  return (
    <View>
      <Button onEnter={() => console.log('Enter pressed')}>Button 1</Button>
      {/* More components... */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, buttons will handle the `Enter` key press and log a message to the console. Adjust the key mappings and handlers as needed for your application.
